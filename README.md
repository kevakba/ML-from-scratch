# ML-from-scratch

- This repository contains some of the Machine Learning algorithms built from scratch. By *scratch* I mean to use only basic python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, math, etc. and not high level APIs like SKlearn, Tensorflow, PyTorch, etc.
- Purpose of this repository is to learn the working behind different ML algorithms
